# MazeGame
A Java application that generates mazes and lets the user solve them. 

#####The program currently supports:
* Player paths - see your path through the maze, as well as where you had to backtrack so you don't make the same mistake twice
* Very large maze size - mazes can be very large, up to 65535 by 65535 cells, though they won't fit on your screen
* Customizable start and finish points
* Multiple players - Up to two players are currently supported (with WASD and Arrow keys controlling Player 1 and Player 2 respectively), but a very large amount could be supported once I implement better input handling

#####Coming soon:
* Multiple algorithms - different algorithms mean different looking mazes with ranging difficulties
* More than 2 players
* Scrolling for mazes that are too big for the screen (though they would take forever to complete)

#####Planned, but not going to be implemented for a while:
* Online play - host or join a server and play with your friends or compete with people around the world
* 3-dimensional mazes - take stairs up or down to different floors of the maze
* Better graphics - possibly 3D with an actual art aesthetic
