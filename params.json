{"name":"MazeGame","tagline":"The ultimate maze-solving game","body":"# MazeGame\r\nA Java application that generates mazes and lets the user solve them. \r\n\r\n#####The program currently supports:\r\n* Player paths - see your path through the maze, as well as where you had to backtrack so you don't make the same mistake twice\r\n* Very large maze size - mazes can be very large, up to 65535 by 65535 cells, though they won't fit on your screen\r\n* Customizable start and finish points\r\n* Multiple players - Up to two players are currently supported (with WASD and Arrow keys controlling Player 1 and Player 2 respectively), but a very large amount could be supported once I implement better input handling\r\n\r\n#####Coming soon:\r\n* Multiple algorithms - different algorithms mean different looking mazes with ranging difficulties\r\n* More than 2 players\r\n* Scrolling for mazes that are too big for the screen (though they would take forever to complete)\r\n* Different maze shapes - solve mazes in the shap of a circle, diamond, etc... or mazes that have holes in them\r\n\r\n#####Planned, but not going to be implemented for a while:\r\n* Online play - host or join a server and play with your friends or compete with people around the world\r\n* 3-dimensional mazes - take stairs up or down to different floors of the maze\r\n* Better graphics - possibly 3D with an actual art aesthetic\r\n","google":"UA-63601425-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
